SMPP is a protocol used by the telecommunications industry for exchanging SMS messages between Short Message Service Centers (SMSC) and External Short Messaging Entities (ESME).

Many SMS Center services allow SMPP protocol for sending SMS.

Note: We don't support TLS for SMPP right now. This will be added in future releases.
